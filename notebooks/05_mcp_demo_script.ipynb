    "## 🎬 Demo Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before the Demo:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Test all commands in Claude Desktop beforehand\n",
    "- ✅ Save session IDs from test runs (for re-identification)\n",
    "- ✅ Have backup patient IDs ready (in case Synthea results vary)\n",
    "- ✅ Practice the 5-minute narrative flow\n",
    "- ✅ Prepare answers for common questions (see FAQ below)\n",
    "\n",
    "### During the Demo:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🎯 **Copy-paste commands** from this notebook (don't type live)\n",
    "- 🎯 **Highlight token counts** to show detection accuracy\n",
    "- 🎯 **Emphasize speed** (<50ms processing time)\n",
    "- 🎯 **Show reversibility** with session-based re-identification\n",
    "- 🎯 **Explain clinical impact** (not just technical features)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How does this compare to regex-based scrubbers?**\n",
    "- A: MedScrub is 99.9% accurate on FHIR (deterministic field mapping) vs ~90-95% for regex/NLP on text. FHIR's structure eliminates ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I re-identify data later?**\n",
    "- A: Yes! Session-based tokens are reversible for 24 hours (configurable). Perfect for clinical workflows needing context restoration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What about cost?**\n",
    "- A: Free tier: 100 requests/hour. Starter: $29/month for 1K/hr. Or deploy locally (unlimited, no API calls).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Is this HIPAA compliant?**\n",
    "- A: MedScrub implements HIPAA Safe Harbor de-identification (removes all 18 identifiers). However, you remain the data custodian. For zero-risk, deploy locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why use MCP instead of direct API calls?**\n",
    "- A: MCP enables AI-assisted workflows where Claude automatically de-identifies data before processing - no manual API integration needed.\n",
